<p>I do hope we survive, and thrive to the struggles life throws at us at every bend.</p>
<p>I do hope we maintain our sanity, our happiness, our health, and our sense of purpose.</p>
<p>And I hope that despite our busy lives, in the future, we would still be able to spend nights like those, sitting around a chair with food on the table, and with good cheer to go around.</p>
