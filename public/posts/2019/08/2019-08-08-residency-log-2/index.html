<p>As if they haven&rsquo;t been through what we are going through.</p>
<p>As if they have no idea how fast paced the work in the OR is.</p>
<p>As if they&rsquo;re oblivious to how many meals, and how much sleep is lost during our tour of duty.</p>
<p>Implementing new rules are okay, as long as they make sense, as long as they improve the efficiency of our work.</p>
<p>But these logbooks. These redundancies in paper form. Surely, there&rsquo;s a better way to record the happenings in the operating room. Perhaps one already exists.</p>
<p>Being a senior must be difficult, certainly there are things we juniors are not able to grasp just because of the experience gap, but we would appreciate it if we actually have a participation, or at least some feedback from these snap decisions they make every now and then.</p>
<p>Perhaps our leaders could learn a thing or two from the Alethi codes of war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong>: The officer will require no action of his soldiers that he would not be willing to perform himself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Times like this, I am seriously contemplating just quitting this program altogether. Find <em>humane</em> work someplace else. Somewhere that does not demand all your limbs when you give an arm out to help.</p>
