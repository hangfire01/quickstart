<p>After the extended pre-residency period, I have been accepted in my residency program of choice. A choice made with the knowledge that this would help me grow into becoming the physician I aspire to be. That I may be properly equipped once I&rsquo;ve set sail in career &ldquo;in the real world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And what better place is there on this side of the world other than the feared regional hospital?</p>
<p>I first heard of this place at second year nursing school. Horror stories here and there. Nonstop work, patients overflowing so much so that they have to utilize the corridors as beds (and as I would later experience, even the spaces outside the main door of the wards). And true enough, or on the job training experiences there proved to be truly terrifying. But that&rsquo;s for another story.</p>
<p>I must admit right now, that so far, it has not been easy, not that I was expecting it to be. So much has happened over the course of these five months, and I often find it difficult to keep up, physically and mentally. I am aware that this is what I signed up for, well aware that in order to become a half-decent physician, a price has to be paid. And it is paid in blood and sweat, and sleepless nights. So many sleepless nights.</p>
<p>This is not to say it&rsquo;s all terrible. In the same timespan, we have developed an significant knowledge in our clinical knowledge, clinical eye, and skills. Bit by bit, we&rsquo;re evolving as physicians, hopefully for the better.</p>
<p>But man, how times have change. What is this feeling of perpetual tiredness?</p>
