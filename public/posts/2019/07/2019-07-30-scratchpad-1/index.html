<p>I have been doing that all this time. Now is the time to rest.</p>
<p>//No, work doesn&rsquo;t end at the hospital. You know that better than I do.</p>
<p>Yes. There are cases to log, reports to finish, papers and deadlines. But may I please take this time to rest?</p>
<p>//Sure. We both know what you would do anyway. Succumb to that feeling of tiredness. Do your work when under extreme pressure to finish. That&rsquo;s how you survived this far, right?</p>
<p>Yes, thanks for the reminder. Look, I swear I&rsquo;ll finish it this week, alright? Just let me have these few hours to regain my energy.</p>
<p>//It&rsquo;s been years. What energy is there to regain? Filling emptiness with more emptiness doesn&rsquo;t accomplish much.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>//*sigh* Admit it. You&rsquo;re tired. You&rsquo;re unhappy. You want to escape. This lifestyle, it&rsquo;s not working out for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a better life than most people have. And someday, when I finish this, things will change for the better. I can finally achieve a less toxic life with more freedom.</p>
<p>//That MAY be true, but at what cost?</p>
<p>The price is high. And I don&rsquo;t know if I could make it. I have lost so much for this already, and giving up feels like an act of cowardice.</p>
<p>//Whatever is you seek to gain here, it better be worth it then.</p>
