Perhaps it was too presumptuous to think that anesthesia is not as bad as the other clinical departments when it comes to the toxic seniority culture and the juniors get the most work and scutwork. What I do find odd in my current state is that it is not the most senior who are the gravest practitioners of this culture, no, it&rsquo;s the least-senior of the seniors, in my case - the resident who started 2 months - that&rsquo;s right 2 months ahead of us. For what normally is 1 year of absolute junior-ship, this person was quickly elevated to a senior and for some reason, despite all of us being 1st year residents, this person no longer does the intense scutwork a junior does and is quick to give orders and pass work around.">

<p>Perhaps it was too presumptuous to think that anesthesia is not as bad as the other clinical departments when it comes to the toxic seniority culture and the juniors get the most work and scutwork.

<p>At work, you get an idea on what kind of behavior you want to emulate and what behavior you would want to avoid doing when you get to that level.</p>
<p>I would also add that one of the disadvantages of not being in a private institution anymore is the lack of systems in check in the lower levels. An example, as I stated, is a first years job description includes this, and that, but for some reason, a first year that started earlier is exempt from all scutwork because there are new first years? Sounds like utter horse manure to me.</p>
