<p>And before you say, &ldquo;nawww, I know you, this is just some play of self-pity, you&rsquo;re really a decent person.&rdquo; And to that, I say thank you, but I really am being honest when I say that. I do procrastinate still, and a lot, and spent most of my time wasting said precious time. The worst part is I am well aware of what I&rsquo;m doing (or not doing).</p>
<p>Perhaps being honest to yourself isn&rsquo;t the solution. As much as I would love to embrace this mediocre, comfortable life, and would probably survive on it, I know there&rsquo;s so much more I am capable of, and have spent more effort on self-sabotage instead of capitalizing on this knowledge.</p>
<p>So lie? Lie about being someone industrious and dependable. Pretend to play the part of someone who actually contributes something to the community. Perhaps here, honesty isn&rsquo;t the solution. Gotta fake till you make it! Cliches are gr8.</p>
<p>Or maybe honesty is just part of the solution, and lying is part of the solution, and that the solution is so complex but worth understanding because it gives you a better impression of who you want to be and what you really want in life and wow before this starts to become even more deeper and complicated that may require a strong drink (sour milk?) I would stop here.</p>
