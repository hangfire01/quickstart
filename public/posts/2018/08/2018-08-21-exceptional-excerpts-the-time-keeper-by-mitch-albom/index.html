<p>&ldquo;You were one person,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;And you changed the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only God can write the end of your story.&rdquo; &ldquo;God has left me alone,&rdquo; Dor said. The old man shook his head. &ldquo;You were never alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember this always: There is a reason God limits man&rsquo;s days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you are not getting the love you want, giving makes you think you will.</p>
<p>A man who can take anything will find most things unsatisfying. And a man without memories is just a shell.</p>
<p>Time flies with you. Dor shook his head. &ldquo;The phrase. What does it mean?&rdquo; Sarah wondered if he was kidding. &ldquo;Time flies? You now, like, time goes really fast and suddenly you&rsquo;re saying good-bye and it&rsquo;s like no time passed at all?&rdquo; His eyes drifted. He liked it.</p>
<p>A heart weights more when it splits in two; it crashed in the chest like a broken plane.</p>
<p>Knowing something and understanding it were not the same thing.</p>
<p>Common sense has no place in first love and never has.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun and the moon. They are far away. I only want to know who I will marry. If you can tell me hard things, why can&rsquo;t you tell me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hurting ourselves to inflict pain on others is just another to be loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made such a fool of myself,&rdquo; she lamented. &ldquo;Love does not make you a fool.&rdquo; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t love me back.&rdquo; &ldquo;That does not make you a fool, either.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just tell me &hellip;&rdquo; her voice cracked. &ldquo;When does it stop hurting?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sometimes never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had many more years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want them.&rdquo; &ldquo;But they wanted you. Time is not something you give back. The very next moment may be an answer to your prayer. To deny that is to deny the most important part of the future.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ends are for yesterdays, not tomorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a reason God limits our days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;To make each one precious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All who are born are always dying.</p>
