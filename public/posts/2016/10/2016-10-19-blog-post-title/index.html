I always thought it&rsquo;s hard to make new friends, but making enemies, I guess that&rsquo;s easy.
&hellip;Is a totally random quote I took from an indie game I played. I have but one purpose in making this blog, I guess you can call this my ultimatum, for all my failed attempts at creating a blog, and all the projects I had involving a few bright people which turned to dust. Having an idea is easy. Committing to it, an entirely different and difficult thing. Still, being hardheaded is sort of my thing, and there are ideas I never can abandon, despite the constant motion and chaos that goes in this semi-functional brain of mine. A blog, or at least an online repository of my cerebral vomit, belongs in that list. I would say I was most successful (or least-failed?) during the year 2013-2014 when a site called the7thheart was born, and was functional for a while. It was a solo site, and there were, at most, five visitors, I think, but man did it thrive. Course I archived its contents to an excruciating amount of files, and reading back my thoughts at the time rekindled my ever-variable desire to write. So here it is, for one last time, and, I guess we&rsquo;ll see how it goes. Ad astra per aspera.">
