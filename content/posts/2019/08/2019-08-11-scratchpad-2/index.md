Going out with old friends in your mid to late 20's belongs to one of the simpler joys of life. What with all of many other friends who are going on with their lives, some staying withing the confines of our vicinity, while others, going thousands of miles away.

It's a breath of fresh air to converse with familiar people, those with whom you've shared a lot of history and life's trials, both the mundane and extraordinary with. There's a sense of nostalgia as we tell stories from our childhood, and the same time we walk about how we are at the present, and our plans for the future. Adulting is a difficult task, and our responsibilities to our loved ones, the decisions we have to make, and the sacrifices that must be done are all but a shared struggle we each have. It's nice having to share these thoughts with these people, and perhaps, in our own ways, be able to help each other out, even if it's as little an action as listening.

I do hope we survive, and thrive to the struggles life throws at us at every bend.

I do hope we maintain our sanity, our happiness, our health, and our sense of purpose.

And I hope that despite our busy lives, in the future, we would still be able to spend nights like those, sitting around a chair with food on the table, and with good cheer to go around.
