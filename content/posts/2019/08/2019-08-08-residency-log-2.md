Our out of touch seniors.

As if they haven't been through what we are going through.

As if they have no idea how fast paced the work in the OR is.

As if they're oblivious to how many meals, and how much sleep is lost during our tour of duty.

Implementing new rules are okay, as long as they make sense, as long as they improve the efficiency of our work.

But these logbooks. These redundancies in paper form. Surely, there's a better way to record the happenings in the operating room. Perhaps one already exists.

Being a senior must be difficult, certainly there are things we juniors are not able to grasp just because of the experience gap, but we would appreciate it if we actually have a participation, or at least some feedback from these snap decisions they make every now and then.

Perhaps our leaders could learn a thing or two from the Alethi codes of war:

> **Leadership**: The officer will require no action of his soldiers that he would not be willing to perform himself.

Times like this, I am seriously contemplating just quitting this program altogether. Find _humane_ work someplace else. Somewhere that does not demand all your limbs when you give an arm out to help.
