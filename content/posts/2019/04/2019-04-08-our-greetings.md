Perhaps it's one of the most basic, and also the most reasonable ways of greeting someone.

"Hey! How have you been doing?"

"Been doing okay, thanks!"

"Really?"

Pause. At this moment I consider, is this person here for trivialties of greeting, or do I take the challenge of the question with sincerity?

I'm really not sure if I am okay. I am tired most of the time. I do not get enough sleep. I do not eat at consistent times of the day, perhaps not even eating consistently. It's almost always too many, or too less. I am trying to make my way into the adult world, but my career choice makes it exponentially difficult. Perhaps the regret of becoming a doctor will be a constant part of my life, how ungrateful, isn't it? So many people aspire to be part of thisÂ _noble_ profession, and yet here I am, complaining about it. I do have options, and my choice of training right now, though still toxic, and still takes up a lot of time, is relatively better compared to other specialty training programs. I could choose to be a general practitioner, to take the year off, to moonlight, but I don't know. My mindset is that my suffering now will eventually pay off later, instead of living a good life now, but knowing that later on, I would have to go through this sufferring still. Might as well start sooner, and get it over with sooner, right?

I do hope I possess enough endurance to see this through. I constantly take physical, mental, (and financial) beatings, and I don't know if I could even make it now, if not for all the friends and family who have my back through thick and thin.

I still feel I am somehow robbed of my youth, of experiencing what so many young people, so many of my batchmates have been through, as they have the time, and the financial capacity to do these things.

But what can I do? I am in so deep, so much is already invested here, that choosing a different path is more likely than not a waste, a gamble easy to lose.

So I stay, and I remain hopeful, for as long as my back can carry these burdens, and there are people, good people, to inspire, motivate, and support me.

But in reality, what I would respond is, "yeah, really," as we both are on our way to leave the exchange of pleasantries and go on with our lives.
