How long has it been?

What compels me to write?

It's usually an emotion. Usually on the negative side. Not saying that joy is not a motivator to write, just that it happens so rarely these days.

About to go into my third year of residency training. You would think it gets easier as you progress. You couldn't be any more wrong. While _most_ problems of being a junior are abolished, they are replaced by a rabid army of new problems, ready to bark and bite at any given time.

And one would think toxic seniors would be a thing of the past, too. The thing is, there will always be that person ranked above you in any form of organizational structure who unreasonably wants to make your life hell. As if life these days aren't difficult enough already. Even worse is when these very people are the ones who rise in greater positions of power.

I do believe that the world is large enough, and that I can weave my life in a way that I can definitely avoid these people who are veritable sources of stress in my life. But now is not that time, since I am in training. Twenty-seven years of age and still caught in this cycle of brown-nosing. It's often nauseating.

I constantly question if I am where I want to be. I am aware of the advantages I enjoy in life, and it must be ignorant of me to speak of unhappiness of where I am, but I also find it unfruitful to lie.

I don't think I ask for much, but a simple life seems so beyond my grasp ever since I started this career in medicine.

Still, I would hope. I am hard-pressed to make the correct decision as so I would not repeat the mistakes a lot of my family members have committed. But time is running out, not just for me, but also the people I love and trust.

Perhaps there's a way out of this labyrinth.
