Senior year.

You'd think at this point, we'd be having it easy, as it appeared our seniors have had it easy then.

As much as I would like to entertain their, "once you become seniors, you would understand" spiels then, let me enumerate some things that has changed since our junior years.

1. COVID
2. Surge of neurosurgery cases
3. Surge of pediatric (neonate) cases
4. Surge of elective-emergencies
5. Surge of Class IV patients
6. Pain Rotation
7. Intensive Care Unit Rotation
8. Out Patient Department Operations
9. Out Patient Department Clinic

And we're all expected to juggle these with a very limited amount of manpower?

Most days I would laugh at how absurd life at the anesthesiology department is. Reality is stranger than fiction, huh.

A lot of my previous passions and hopes have turned to cynicism and sarcasm. I'd like to think I haven't lost all hope, but on many a moment, I just want out. Out this hospital, and the life it "offers" to us residents. Truly, there is a dire and terrible cancer plaguing the medical training program of this hospital, if not the entire country. Promising, intelligent doctors put through inhumane obstacles, disguising it as "trials by fire" under the notion that "pressure makes diamonds". While I do believe hardships are part and parcel of life and learning, I also believe that amounts more than necessary, which is often not a lot, they are simple destructive.

And what is being done to address our larger problems, such as, the lack of manpower despite the rapidly expanding facility and services, the lack of maintenance of existing facilities, the lack of stocks of what should be essential items for a functional hospital? Band aid solutions at best. Often, neglect.

Perhaps the time to leave and to shake the dust off our feet has come.

I am a senior, and I do understand. I also have been a junior, and even then, I understood.

What a load of chickensh\*t.
