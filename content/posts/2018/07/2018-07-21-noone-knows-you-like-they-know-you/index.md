Here's a song commemorating all those old friends we have, and how there's nobody else quite like them. How despite being adults, we would always treasure those moments when we spent most of our days together, and how even though we have changed in the biggest of ways, there are parts of us that haven't changed at all.

_Can you take me back when we were kids Who weren't scared of getting older? 'Cause no one knows you like they know you And no one probably ever will_
