Today is the 17th of September.

Supposedly, this would be the day after the Physicians Licensure Exam for this September. Turns out the weather has other plans and the forces of nature do not abide by man-made schedules. I'm still glad the PRC made the call, albeit somewhat of a buzzer beater, postponing the board examinations have saved some of the lives of would-be life savers.

I am ambivalent towards the past few weeks, composed of the final stretch of board exam preparations, and the first half of the board exam itself. The atmosphere in the dormitory I live in is often heavy, with thoughts of everything we have laid years, almost a decade so far, of study for at the whims of a series of 100-item exams.  We staved away our anxieties, minimizing the damage that may befall upon us via failing, by cramming on our various materials, or in my case, sleeping for most of the day.  I've been called out for my lack of a sense of care for the boards, and I must admit, I am guilty as charged, but I am not devoid of care for it. Just that I see no benefit of being overly stressed out about it. I do worry that this would be easily be mistranslated as overconfidence or arrogance, but my mindset is I do what I want, what I deem would be "high-yield", choose which materials to study, to finish, go with it, take the exams, if I must pass, then I will, but if I should fail, it would give me sadness, but I know that it is not the end of the world. Sure, our licenses to practice are at stake here, but I trust that we were guided well enough during our years of studying medicine, and that we have developed, adapted (or maladapted) the skills needed in order to pass these exams, and if not, then good thing you can take the board exams more than once.  Very likely I am talking from a position of privilege, it must be easy to say, oh, he has a backup plan, or is not under pressure from family, or from his school, etc. etc., and I would not deny that. I trust my family would be supportive enough to understand if I fail, and if not, I am responsible enough to deal with my failure.

Still, I remain hopeful to pass the board exams.  Drain me of everything, but deprive me not of hope. We will make it through this, all of us.
