This feels as close to a vacation as I could get.

I am currently in quarantine after a continuous 7-day duty as part of our hospital's Covid-Response Team. It's been ten days since we have been swabbed, and it seems that our initial swab, which was sent to a laboratory in Manila for testing, instead made its way to oblivion. We will be having a repeat swab tomorrow, which will be tested at our base hospital, as it has recently opened its molecular laboratory.
