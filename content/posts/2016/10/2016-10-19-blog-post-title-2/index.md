I feel like I've lost a few friends along the way. Well,Â _losing_ isn't the exact word for it. My grandfather told me to be more precise when it comes to using words. It pays to read widely every once in a while or as often as we could. No it's not loss. It's the distance, and the good and the bad the comes with it But I do believe people come in our lives to help us grow, and for those moments that they are here we have to be grateful and when we grow apart we must remain grateful New friends will arrive, for sure but as the song goes, _nothing beats old friends._
